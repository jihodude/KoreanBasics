        <p>He was born in May 15, 1397 as the third son of  King <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Taejong_of_Joseon" target="_blank">Taejong Yi Bang-won</a> and Queen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Wongyeong" target="_blank">Wongyeong</a>, He was the first king of the Joseon Dynasty who did not abdicate the throne. He was born as the third son of his father Jeong An-gun(Taejong Yi Bang-won) in Junsu Bang, Hanseong (now Tongin-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul), and was sealed in Changnyeong-gun in the 8th year of King Taejong's reign (1408), and was promoted to Chungnyeongdaegun along with his second brother <a href”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Hyoryeong”>Hyoryeong Daegun</a> in the 12th year of King Taejong's reign (1412). </p>
        <p>Sejong liked reading as a child, one day he would read until his eyes were damaged. his eyes were severely damaged but he continued reading. Taejong Yi Bang-won had to force him to stop and take the books away, however he unintentionally found a book behind a folding screen and read the same book about 1000 times until it was worn.</p>
        <p>In 1418 when his first brother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Yangnyeong" target="_blank">Yangnyeongdaegun</a>, became a defunct prince, Sejong became a crown prince.

It was developed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul" target="_blank">Hangeul</a> by <a href="http://peacemaker.prkorea.com/jusigyeong/" target="_blank">Ju Si-gyeong</a> in the 20th century, and is widely used today as the official Korean alphabet. Also, October 9 is celebrated as Hangul Day. </p>
